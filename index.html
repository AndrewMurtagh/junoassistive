		<h1>Tech That Cares</h1>
		<h2>Robotics and IoT for the care industry</h2>


		<p class="row spacing-bottom-small">The care industry will be faced with two major problems over the coming decades: a shortage of staff and a growing number of people requiring care. Without distrubtion many people will be left uncared for when they need it most. This is the impetus behind Juno Assistive where we are trying to deal with this problem by using the latest technology has to offer. So far, we are developing two products we hope will ensure that <b>everyone can be cared for</b> during their twilight years.</p>


		<div class="row spacing-bottom-medium">
			<div class="col-sm-6 spacing-bottom-small">
				<h3>Stevie</h3>

				<p>Stevie is a social care robot. He is designed to address many of the problems faced in care facilities, he will help carers deliver a high quality of care to residents. Stevie can perform simple tasks like anomaly detection, object delivery, guidance, security patrols, entertainment and providing information. However, since he is not a fully autonomous robot, Stevie can also facilitate tele-presence and connect residents to skilled carers remotely. In this way Stevie can perform high value activties such as routine bed checking, first response and medication reminders.</p>

        </div>

			<div class="col-sm-6 spacing-bottom-small">
				<h3>Smart Sense</h3>

				<p>Smart Sense is a suite of connected IoT sensor modules that monitor conditions in care facilties. The small sensor modules are installed in the bedrooms, bathrooms and common rooms of homes and measure key metrics of the environment such as: CO2 levels, room occupancy, temperature, noise levels and more. These metrics can be monitored in real-time through an online console. You can also produce reports and heatmaps of your facility, identify areas of improvement and set custom rules for events. An example of this might include  alerting staff, or Stevie, if a resident has not been in their bed for more than one hour during the night.</p>

		<h3>For Residents</h3>

		<p>Those who require care the most are first in the minds of Juno Assistive. We have engaged with users over a period of two years and are working to ensure that they receive the care they require.</p>


		<h3>For Carers</h3>
		<p>We know the pressure placed on carers to provide higher levels of care with less resources. Juno Assistive is here to ease the burden placed on carers and augment their abilities. By easing the workload of carers, it frees them to take the time to provide a more person level of care.</p>


		<h3>For Families</h3>
		<p>Knowing that your loved ones receives the quality of care they deserve is big on the minds of families, we are here to provide peace of mind to families and increase transparency in the care industry.</p>


		<h3>For Organisations</h3>
		<p>In a commoditised market with increasing competition and pressure to decrease costs, having the latest technology can help distinguish your facility as a leader in the field.</p>

		<h1>The Story so far</h1>
		<h2>The past present and future of Juno Assistive</h2>

		<p>The team behind Juno Assistive have been developing robots and other technology aimed at assisted living for the past ten years. This has primarily existed in a research capacity at <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.tcd.ie/mecheng/research/robotics/">Trinity College Dublin</a>. We have built several robots, taken part in multiple competitions and have written many peer-reviewed papers but now we are applying this knowledge and experience to solve real problems faced in society.</p>

		<p>Over the next two years we will improve our technology to the point where it can be safely and reliably deployed. We aim to release it by 2020 with several pilots before then. If you are interested in becoming involved in this process please contact us.</p>
