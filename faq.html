	            <h3>Who is Juno Assistive?</h3>
	            <p>Juno Assistive is comprised of mechanical engineers, designers, software engineers, Ph.D. studentes and Professors. The group has existed since 2007 and has recenlty spun out from research to start commercialising robotics.</p>

	            <h3>What is your mission?</h3>
	            <p>Our mission is to help elderly people live longer by allowing them to engage with the latest technology.</p>

	            <h3>What is the future of Juno Assistive?</h3>
	            <p>Over the next two years we will be developing the technology to a commercial standard. Beyond that we will be taking on private investment to grow the team and release products.</p>

	        <div class="row spacing-medium border-bottom" id="stevie">
	            <h1 class="no-subtitle">Stevie</h1>


	            <h3>What can he do?</h3>
	            <p>Stevie is learning to do new things every day. Once ready he will be able to perform security patrols, play music and games, connect people with their loved ones, detect anomalies, deliver objects, perform regular bed checks and many other things.</p>

	            <h3>What is his purpose?</h3>
	            <p>Stevie is being built to help elderly people maintain a good quality of life for as long as possible and to help carers provide a high quality of care for elderly people. He will be placed in care homes.</p>

	            <h3>Will he replace jobs?</h3>
	            <p>Stevie is designed to <b>engage people with technology</b> not replace them with it.</p>

	            <h3>Do elderly people need a robot?</h3>
	            <p>A short of jobs in the care industry and a growing number of elderly people means that there will be a shortage of care over the coming decades. We believe that a robot-assisted solution has the potential to meet this shortage.</p>

	            <h3>Who is he for?</h3>
	            <p>Stevie is designed to help elderly people, carers, families and care organistions.</p>

	            <h3>How can I get one?</h3>
	            <p>Stevie is still being developed and will be ready to ship in 2021. He will not be available for public purchase but will be offered as a service to care facilities and nursing homes, if you are interested in getting Stevie please <a class="hyperlink" href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

	            <h3>How much does he cost?</h3>
	            <p>Stevie will not be available to purchase outright. Rather, he will be offered as a service with a fixed once-off setup fee and a monthly fee thereafter. The exact prices have not yet been determined.</p>

	            <h3>Why is he called Stevie?</h3>
	            <p>An office joke gone wrong.</p>

	            <h1 class="no-subtitle">Smart Sense</h1>


	            <h3>What is Smart Sense?</h3>
	            <p>Smart Sense is a suite of connected sensor modules that detect important events in care homes such as people falling out of beds, environmental variables, and so on. This information is available on an online console.</p>

	            <h3>What do they measure?</h3>
	            <p>They measure room occupancy, bed occupancy, noise levels, temperature, movement between rooms, light levels, CO2 levels, frequency of visits and many more.</p>

	            <h3>How do they help?</h3>
	            <p>By understanding the environment we can improve visibility and make better decisions.</p>
